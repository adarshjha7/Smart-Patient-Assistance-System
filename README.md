**We have developed Smart Patient Assistance System(sPa-s)**.
Many patients require **constant monitoring of their blood pressure or heartrate or other metrics**. 
Our solution makes these services accessible to these patients** without having to visit hospitals or pharmaceuticals frequently**. They can easily monitor their own metrics.

The wrist band has integrated sensors which is connected to a web-application. 
The application consists of various data of like Healthcare consisting of doctor’s data of the patient and pharma outlets that consist of information regarding nearby hospitals and chemists.

We have **another section ‘proctor’ that contain various sub-sections to measure body temperature, heart rate, ECG, respiratory and blood pressure.**
In addition, if any mishappening or accident occurs, the patient can press the button and a **call is initiated to authority along with video recording**. In addition, a **SMS containing google drive link of the video is a also sent.
